 ``Chef Recipies`` -- For working with Vagrant.
==========================================================

A set of Chef recipies that I am using to provision virtual machines with
Vagrant for local development. They cut corner, do bad things and for this 
reason shouldn't be used for deployment - however, they could be adapted 
fairly easily to work well with both.

Please excuse my poor attempt at Ruby. This is my first attempt, suggestions 
and patches are welcome.
